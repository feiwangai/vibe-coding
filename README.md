# vibe-coding

I don't know exactly what ['vibe coding'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) means but it does sound very cool.


In this repository, we will create a simple dashboard center that will allow the user to:

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) their long-term goals
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) their OKRs
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) their learning preferences

User experience and user interface is very important. We aim to create the best possible experience for the user.
